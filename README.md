# CYK
Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm

Verify if a word is generated by a context-free grammar in the normal Chomsky form (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_normal_form)

date.in: 

numeber of terminals + list of terminals (as strings)
numeber of nonterminals + list of nonterminals (as strings) where the fist nonterminal is the production start

numeber of production: A -> AB or D -> d
list of productions as: "A B C" as "A -> AB" or "D d" as "D -> d"

number of words to verify:
  number of stings the word has: the strings

Answer: Yes/No for each word

The current grammar in "date.in" verifies if a enumerations of parentheses are correct
